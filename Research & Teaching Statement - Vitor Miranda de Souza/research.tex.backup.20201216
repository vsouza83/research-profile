%INTRO (1p)

In the automotive industry, I became aware of many problems that originated in supporting rather than technical or operational processes. Hence, I have shifted my focus from Mechanical to Industrial Engineering and Social Sciences, according to Carl Folke's idea that "technology alone cannot solve cultural problems". Aiming to "do the right things right", I have wielded "a net" of methodology \cite{self1978} to solve problems on waste production and recovery; in the following paragraphs, I present my plans to evolve in this direction. 

%INTERESTS (3p)

Within the domains of Sustainable Development and Operations Management, I am keen to investigate transdisciplinary problems, proposing solutions based on design approaches like Biomimetics or regenerative design \cite{Pohl2008,Mang2017}. These solutions can be modelled as complex adaptive systems, integrating multiple paradigms like System Dynamics, and Agent-based Modelling, simulating their emergence, ultimately shaping policies that drive and accelerate the transition to a more sustainable society.

There is so much waste and pollution yet to be designed out, materials to close circularity loops and environment to be regenerated \cite{EllenMacArthurFoundation2015}. My research will: 

\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*]
    \item design the emergence (or self-organisation) of socio-technical systems that regenerate the environment; 
    \item optimise their environmental, social and economic performance, and; 
    \item ensure their resilience.
\end{enumerate}

%PLANS:

In the short term, I am building on work developed in my thesis to design a regenerative waste management network for the region where I live; the Norte Pioneiro, in the state of Paran√°. The network generates environmental, social and economic gains, and reinvest profit from waste management for the restoration of dumping grounds and landfills. With the European Union set for broad adoption of the Circular Economy, I am proposing a research project to increase the circularity of materials through repair, reuse and remanufacturing cycles. For the medium term, I am planning to contribute to the theory of measurement and monitoring systems resilience. Thus, I will keep developing socio-technical-environmental frameworks to encompass "the entire system of relationships" \cite{self1978}. These frameworks will support a new design approach that I want to develop, the design for emergence.
