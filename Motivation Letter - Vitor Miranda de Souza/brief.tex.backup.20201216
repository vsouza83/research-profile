%1 - MOTIVATION

I am writing to apply for the position of "\position", given the exciting opportunity it provides to work in a prestigious university within my field of expertise. I aspire to engineer transdisciplinary solutions that generate long-term environmental and societal benefits, and to transmit my passion on Sustainable Development to the students. 

%WHY ME? 

%PAragrafo3-professional experience - industry
My engineering skills have been crafted since my childhood. In fifteen years of professional experience - five leading development teams in the automotive industry, and another five teaching -, I learned skills like product design and development, project management, collaboration, moderation, and crisis management. I was also fortunate to work overseas, as a Cost Engineer in an engineering office, and as a PhD student under the supervision of an excellent supervisor, in an inspiring atmosphere. My contribution to scientific literature is detailed in five scientific articles and my PhD Thesis. I also participated in international collaborations developing research proposals. This year, I submitted another on the assessment of the eco-effectiveness of a solid waste state policy, and I am currently working on the design and optimisation of a restorative waste management network. 

After five years teaching machine design courses and supervising students' thesis, my enthusiasm for watching students overcome their potential only grows. I like teaching engineering fundamentals, product design and development, complex adaptive systems and sustainability science. To become an excellent teacher, I keep developing active learning skills even after formal teaching evaluations were suspended due to the COVID-19. Nevertheless, I have received positive feedback from students through public testimonials or writing. In the administrative sphere, I led a successful development of a new structure for the bachelor in Mechanical Engineering.  

%PAragrafo4-conclusion
I am comfortable balancing collaborative and individual work, and I wish to pursue academic research. My background on Mechanical and Industrial Engineering and my expertise in design, modelling and project management make me confident I can bring substantial contribution to the OPAC group. I'm looking forward to discussing this position with you, and I remain available to provide you with any additional information you might need.
