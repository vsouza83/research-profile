%Teaching Goals and Experience

%INTRO (1p)

As a teacher, I realise a symbiosis of my engineer father with my educator mother. Halfway through my professional career, I realised I am passionate by the academic atmosphere and the responsibility of conducting students through the learning process until they realise - or overcome - their potential. 

%EXPERIENCE (2p)

Currently, I teach Dynamics of Rigid Bodies and Machine Elements Design. I have been teaching Machine Elements Design for a long time, in technical schools, private and public universities, in different regions in the Paraná state. I also have experience teaching courses on Mechanics of Materials, Metrology, Technical Drawing, CAD Drawing, and Microeconomics, for bachelors in Mechanical, Automation and Control, Electric, Electronic Engineering; Administration and Quality management. I also had a short international teaching experience at Wageningen University and Research, supporting students in the course of Quality System Operations. 

I started eleven years ago in Curitiba, teaching evening courses for teenagers from low-income families. After getting my masters degree, I was hired by a private university, teaching undergraduate students in night and morning shifts. Back then, I was mostly doing expository teaching. Each classroom had around thirty students, most of them working for manufacturing companies: some students worked late-night shifts, coming straight from work to the morning courses. A year later, I became a Lecturer on Mechanical Design for the Federal University of Technology - Paraná (UTFPR). I taught Technical Drawing using drawing desks, and CAD in computer labs, using Solidworks. In both courses, there were around twenty-two students, between eighteen to twenty-one years-old, coming from many regions. In UTFPR, I have also supervised bachelors theses on product validation, maintenance and machine design.

%GOALS (2p)

Since last year, I've been progressively adopting active, problem-based learning techniques. With the COVID-19 pandemic, I rethought the whole learning experience, reshaping content and workload to emphasise soft skills, creating objective criteria to evaluate participation, analysis, communication, and organisation. I carefully design activities for the online meetings with the students, to stimulate critical thinking, initiative and teamwork skills. The attention of beginner, immature students, is better captured through gamification, supervised problem-solving, breakout rooms and quizzes. Project-based activities help advanced students to connect technical concepts seen in previous courses. Communication and feedback are developed through double-blind peer review activities. 

I aspire to be an excellent teacher, and I and motivated to design and teach courses on fundamentals of sustainability science and engineering, transdisciplinarity, circular economy, and modelling and simulation of complex adaptive systems. Teaching students to solve sustainability problems requires that I learn topics on, e.g. geography, biology, economics, management, and statistics, while keeping up with advancements on engineering. 



%Released from the pressure of delivering correct results, student's mistakes are regarded as "degrees for success" and comprehensive knowledge is produced and better internalised.
